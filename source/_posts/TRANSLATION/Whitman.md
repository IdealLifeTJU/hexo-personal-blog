过布鲁克林渡口

1
潮水在我脚下涨起！我面对面地看着你！
西边的云--太阳还有半个钟头就落下--我同样面对面地看着你。

着常服的男男女女的人群，我对你们是多么好奇！
渡船上人们成百上千地渡河，回家，我对你们比你们想象的更加好奇，
对今后的年月里将横渡至对岸的你们，我更加好奇，更多地纳入我的深思，超过你们可能的想象。

2
一天之中从所有时辰的一切事物中到来的，我无形的食粮，
简单，紧密，良好组织着的图景，我自己分崩离析，每个人都分崩离析了，而仍是图景的一部分，
和过去的相似，和将来的相似，
走过街头，渡过河流，在我最细微的视觉和听觉中珠子般串起的光轮，
水流如此迅捷地奔涌，同我一起游向远方，
那些将要跟随我的人，我和他们之间的纽带，
他们的确然性，他们的生活，爱情，所见，所闻。

他们将进入渡口的大门并横渡到对岸，
他们将注视着潮升时的涌流，
他们将看见曼哈顿西方和北方的航运，以及东方和南方的布鲁克林高地，
他们将看见这大大小小的岛屿，
五十年后，在距离日落还有半个钟头时，另一些人将看着他们过河，
一百年后，或者今后无数个世纪之后，另一些人将看着他们，
他们将享受日落，潮升时的涌流，潮退时的跌落。

3
时间不起作用，空间和距离不起作用，
你们这时代的男男女女，或者未来无数个世代的男男女女，我和你们在一起，
正如你们望向河流和天空时有所感受，同样地我曾感受过，
正如你们每个人都是芸芸众生中的一员，我曾是其中的一个，
正如你们被河流的欢悦和明亮的潮水刷新，我曾同样地被更新，
正如你们倚栏站立，同湍流一起飞速前进， 我曾站立并前进过，
正如你们看着船只数不清的桅杆和蒸汽船的粗烟筒，我曾看过。

我曾无数次横渡旧时的这条河，
注视过十二月的海鸥，看它们在高空中凭静止的翅膀悬浮，振荡着它们的身体，
看到过闪耀的金光是如何点亮它们的一部分身体，并将其余留在浓重的阴影里，
看到过夏日天空在水中的倒影，
我的眼睛曾因光线闪烁的轨迹而迷炫，、
看见过日光照射的水面美丽的从我的头影扩散的辐光，
看见过南方和西南方山峰上的尘雾，
看见过羊毛状流动的雾气微染上一些紫色，
向更下方的海湾投注过目光，注意到船只抵达。
看到过它们慢慢接近，我近处的人们登上船只，
看见过纵帆船和单桅帆船的白帆，看见过船只抛锚，
水手们收拾绳索，或横跨桅杆，
圆形的桅柱，船体的转动，细长弯曲的信号旗，
前进着的大大小小的汽船，领航员在他们的舱室里，
行进间留下的白色的航迹，舵盘飞速震颤地旋转，
所有国家的旗帜，日落时它们降下，
暮光中扇贝状的波浪，嬉戏闪光的浪峰，
码头边花岗岩仓库灰色的墙壁，愈来愈黯淡地延伸至远方，
河面上朦胧的一群，巨大的蒸汽拖船从两侧紧靠着货船，干草船，迟到的驳船，
附近的岸上火光从铸造厂的烟筒里高高燃起，耀目地冲向夜空，
红色和黄色的光芒中衬出了它们闪烁的黑影，抛掷过屋顶，投在街道上的裂缝里。

4
所有这些事物过去对我，现在对你们来说，都有同样的意义，
我热爱那些城市，热爱这条雄伟湍急的河流，
我见过的男人和女人全都在我的身边，
其他人同样--人们向后看见我，因为我向前注视着他们，
（这时机终将到来，尽管我今日今夜将在这里停留。）

5
那么我们之间存在着什么？
几十年和百年在我们之间又算得了什么？

不管那是什么，它不起作用--距离不起作用，空间不起作用，
我曾生活过，布鲁克林宏伟的山峰属于我，
我曾在曼哈顿岛上的街道行走，在它周围的海水中沐浴，
我曾感觉到突如其来的新奇疑问在我心中扰动，
白天我在人群中有时它们拜访我，
当我深夜走路回家，或躺在床上时它们拜访我，
我也是由那永远混着在溶液之中的漂浮物所生成，
我的身份同样来自于我的肉体，
我知道过去的我成之于我的肉体，我知道将来的我同样成之于我的肉体。

6
黑暗的碎片不只降落在你身上，
黑暗同样把它的碎片投在我身上，
我曾经完成过的最好的事似乎也显得空虚可疑，
我自以为最好的思想，它们实际上难道不贫乏吗？
你不是懂得邪恶为何物的唯一一人，
我也懂得何谓邪恶，
我也曾编织过古老的矛盾之结，
泄密，惭愧，怨恨，谎言，偷窃，妒忌，
有过狡猾，愤怒，淫欲，不敢言明的热望，
曾经任性，虚荣，贪婪，浅薄，狡诈，懦弱，恶毒，
豺狼，毒蛇，豕豚，在我体内都不缺少， 
欺骗的嘴脸，轻佻的言语，通奸的愿望，都不缺少，
拒绝，仇恨，拖延，吝啬，懒惰，没有一样欠缺，
我也是一个普通人，和其他人一样碰运气度日，
当年轻人看见我接近或经过，我的昵名曾被清晰响亮的嗓音所呼喊，
当我站立时，感受到他们的臂膀环在脖子上，或者当我坐下，他们的肉体随意地倚靠着我，
在大街，渡船和公众集会上，我曾爱过许多人，然而从未对他们吐露过一个字词，
和所有人过着一样的生活，一样的老笑话，烦恼和睡眠，
我扮演过的角色仍然使人回想起某个男女演员，
同样的老角色，我们所成就的角色，和我们喜欢的同样伟大，
或者和我喜欢的一样渺小，或既伟大又渺小。

7
我更加靠近你，
你此时对我产生的想法，我曾如数拥有过，我提前将它们隐藏起来。
在你出生之前。我曾长时间而严肃地斟酌过你，

谁能知道我会领略到什么呢？
谁知道我正享受此事呢？
谁知道，你们这些无法看见我的人，相隔了这么长远的距离，我几乎一样地在看着你们呢？

8
啊，对我来对什么事物能比桅杆包围的曼哈顿更庄严可钦呢？
比得上河流，日落和涨潮时扇贝状的波浪？
比得上振荡着身体的海鸥，暮光中的干草船，迟到的驳船？

什么神明能够超过这些紧握我的手掌，在我靠近时用我喜欢的嗓音迅速而响亮地叫出我的昵名的人？
什么能比这些把我和看着我面庞的女人或男人联系在一起的事物更精微？
现在这事物将我熔化于你，将我的意义倾倒于你。

那么我们是否已经理解彼此？
我已允诺而秘而不宣的事物，你不是已经接受了吗？
学业无法传授，布道无法成就的事物业已完成，不是吗？

9
奔腾吧，河流！在潮涨潮落时奔腾吧！
嬉戏的，带冠而扇形的波浪！
日落时壮丽的云霞！用你的光彩浸透我，或者今后世代的男人和女人
！
在口岸之间穿梭，数不尽的旅客的人群！
站起来，曼哈顿高高的桅杆！站起来，布鲁克林美丽的山脉！
跳动吧，困惑和好奇的头脑！抛出问题和答案！
在这里和所有地方都浮起，永恒漂浮的溶液！
凝视，爱意与渴望的眼睛，在房子里，大街上或露天广场！

响彻吧，青年人的嗓音！嘹亮动听地叫出我的昵名！
去生活吧，古老的生命！扮演那些男女演员曾出演过的部分！
扮演古老的角色，伟大或渺小，都依据背后的演员而定。
思索吧，追赶着我的人，不论我是否以未知的形式注视着你们；
要坚固，河边的栏杆，去支撑那些懒散地倚靠着的人，而要同奔流一起急行；
飞翔吧，海鸟！侧着身子飞行，或者在高空划出巨大的圆圈；
水面呀，接受夏日的天空，忠实地保存住它，直到所有垂下的目光看见！
发散吧，美好的辐光，从水面上我的或任何人的头影！
航行吧，来自下方港口的船只，上下交错的大小帆船和驳船！
飘扬吧，所有国家的旗帜！到日落就准时落下！
你火焰就高扬吧，铸造厂的烟筒！日落时投下黑影！越过房顶投出红色和黄色的火光！

现在或今后的外表，成为你身份的标志！
你必要的薄膜，继续包裹着灵魂，
我的肉体之于我，你的肉体之于你，散溢出最神圣的芳香。
繁荣吧，城市--带来你的货物，带来你的演出，巨大而充沛的河流，
发展吧，大概没有什么事物会比你们更加崇高，
各守其位吧，没有什么事物会比你们更加持久。

你曾经等待过且总是在等待，你沉默美丽的使者，
最后我们以自由的感官接受你，此后就永不满足，
你将再也不能阻止我们，或对我们有所保留，
我们善待你，不将你抛置一旁，我们永远将你放在我们之中，
我们不揣测你--我们喜爱你--也有至善至美在你身上存在，
你向永恒贡献了自己的力量，
伟大或渺小，你向灵魂贡献了自己的一份力量。














Crossing Brooklyn Ferry

1
Flood-tide below me! I see you face to face!
Clouds of the west--sun there half an hour high--I see you also face to face.

Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes, how curious you are to me!
On the ferry-boats the hundreds and hundreds that cross,returning home, are more curious to me than you suppose,
And you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are more to me, and more in my meditations, than you might suppose.

2
The impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours of the day,
The simple, compact, well-join'd scheme, myself disintegrated, every one disintegrated yet part of the scheme,
The similitudes of the past and those of the future,
The glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings, on the walk in the street and the passage over the river,
The current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away,
The others that are to follow me, the ties between me and them,
The certainty of others, the life, love, sight, hearing of others,

Others will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to shore,
Others will watch the run of the flood-tide,
Others will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west, and the heights of Brooklyn to the south and east,
Others will see the islands large and small;
Fifty years hence, others will see them as they cross, the sun half an hour high,
A hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence, others will see them,
Will enjoy the sunset, the pouring-in of the flood-tide, the falling-back to the sea of the ebb-tide.

3
It avails not, time nor place--distance avails not,
I am with you, you men and women of a generation, or ever so many generation hence,
Just as you feel when you look on the river and sky, so I felt,
Just as any of you is one of a living crowd, I was one of a crowd,
Just as you are refresh'd by the gladness of the river and the bright flow, I was refresh'd,
Just as you stand and lean on the rail, yet hurry with the swift current, I stood yet was hurried.
Just as you look on the numberless masts of ships and the thick-stemm'd pipes of steamboat, I look'd.

I too many and many a time cross'd the river of old,
Watched the Twelfth-month sea-gulls, saw them high in the air floating with motionless wings, oscillating their bodies,
Saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and left the rest in strong shadow,
Saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water,
Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams,
Look'd at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my head in the sunlit water,
Look'd on the haze on the hills southward and south-westward,
Look'd on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet,
Look'd toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving,
Saw their approach, saw aboard those that were near me,
Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops, saw the ships at anchor,
The sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars, 
The round masts, the swinging motion of the hulls, the slender serpentine pennants,
The large and small steamers in motion, the pilots in their pilot-houses,
The white wake left by the passage, the quick tremulous whirl of the wheels,
The flags of all nations, the falling of them at sunset,
The scallop-edged waves in the twilight, the ladled cups, the frolicsome crests and glistening,
The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the gray walls of the granite storehouses by the docks,
On the river the shadowy group, the big steam-tug closely flank'd on each side by the barges, the hay-boat, the belated lighter,
On the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning high and glaringly into the night,
Casting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow light over the tops of houses, and down into the clefts of streets.

4
These and all else were to me the same as they are to you,
I loved well those cities, loved well the stately and rapid river,
The men and women I saw were all near to me,
Others the same--others who look back on me because I look'd forward to them,
(The time will come, though I stop here to-day and to-night.)

5
What it is then between us?
What is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us?

Whatever it is, it avails not--distance avails not, and place avails not,
I too lived, Brooklyn of ample hills was mine,
I too walk'd the streets of Manhattan island, and bathed in the waters around it,   
I too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me,
In the day among crowds of people sometimes they came upon me,
In my walks home late at night or as I lay in my bed they came upon me,
I too had been struck from the float forever held in solution, 
I too had receiv'd identity by my body,
That I was I knew was of my body, and what I should be I knew I should be of my body.

6
It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall,
The dark threw its patches down upon me also,
The best I had done seem'd to me blank and suspicious,
My great thoughts as I supposed them, were they not in reality meagre?
Nor is it you alone who know what it is to be evil,
I am he who knew what it was to be evil,
I too knitted the old knot of contrariety,
Blabb'd, blush'd, resented, lied, stole, grudg'd,
Had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared not speak,
Was wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant,
The wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me,
The cheating look, the frivolous word, the adulterous wish, not wanting,
Refusals, hates, postponements, meanness, lazeness, none of these wanting,
Was one with the rest, the days and haps of the rest,
Was call'd by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as they saw me approaching or passing,
Felt their arms on my necks as I stood, or the negligent leaning of their flesh againest me as I sat,
Saw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet never told them a word,
Lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping,
Play'd the part that still looks back on the actor or actress,
The same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we like,
Or as small as we like, or both great and small.

7
Closer yet I approach you,
What thought you have of me now, I had as much of you--I laid in my stores in advance,
I consider'd long and seriously of you before you were born.

Who was to know what should come home to me?
Who knows but I am enjoying this?
Who knows, for all the distance, but I am as good as looking at you now, for all you cannot see me?

8
Ah, what can ever be more stately and admireable to me than mast-hemm'd Manhattan?
River and sunset and scallop-edg'd waves of flood-tide?
The sea-gulls oscillating their bodies, the hay-boat in the twilight, and the belated lighter?

What gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand, and with voices I love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest name as I approach?
What is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or man that looks in my face?
Which fuses me into now, and pours my meaning into you?

We understand then do we not?
What I promis'd without mentioning it, have you not accepted?
What the study could not teach--what the preaching could not accomplish is accomplish'd, is it not?

9
Flow on, river! Flow with the flood-tide, and ebb with the ebb-tide!
Frolic on, crested and scallop-edg'd weaves!
Gorgeous clouds of the sunset! Drench with your splendor me, or the men and women generation after me!
Cross from shore to shore, countless crowds of passengers!
Stand up, tall masts of Mannahatta! Stand up, beautiful hills of Brooklyn!
Throb, baffled and curious brain! throw out questions and answers!
Suspend here and everywhere, eternal float of solution!
Gaze, loving and thirsting eyes, in the house or street or public assembly!

Sound out, voices of young men! Loudly and musically call me by my nighest name!
Live, old life! Play the part that looks back on the actor or actress!
Play the old role, the role that is great or small accroding as one makes it!
Consider, you who peruse me, whether I may not in unknown ways be looking upon you;
Be firm, rail over the river, to support those who lean idly, yet haste with the hasting current;
Fly on, sea-birds! Fly sideways, or wheel in large circles high in the air;
Receive the summer sky, you water, and faithfully hold it till all downcast eyes have time to take it from you!
Diverge, fine spokes of light, from the shape of my head, or any one's head, in the sunlit water!
Come on, ships from the lower bay! Pass up or down, white-sail'd schooners, sloops, lighters!
Flaunt away, flags of all nations! Be duly lower'd at sunset!
Burn high you fires, foundry chimneys! Cast black shadows at nightfall! Cast red and yellow light over the tops of the house!

Appearance, now or henceforth, indicate what you are,
You necessary film, continue to envelop the soul,
About my body for me, and your body for you, be hung out divinest aromas,
Thrive, cities--bring your freight, bring your shows, ample and sufficient rivers,
Expand, being than which none else is perhaps more spirtual,
Keep your places, objects than which none else is more lasting.

You have waited, you always wait, you dumb, beautiful ministers,
We receive you with free sense at last, and are insatiate henceforward,
Not you any more shall be able to foil us, or withhold yourselves from us,
We use you, and do not cast you aside--we plant you permanently within us,
We fathom you not--we love you--there is perfection in you also,
You furnish your parts toward eternity,
Great or small, you furnish your parts toward the soul.

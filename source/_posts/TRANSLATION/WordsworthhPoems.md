一、Composed upon Westminster Brige, September3, 1803

Earth has not any thing to show more fair:
Dull would he be of soul who could pass by
A sight so touching in its majesty:
This City now doth, like a garment,wear
The beauty of the mornings; silent, bare,
Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie upon umto the fields, and to the sky;
All bright and glittering in the smokeless air,
Never did sun more beautifully steep
In his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill;
Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!
The river glideth at his own sweet will;
Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;
And all that mightly heart is lying still!

威斯敏斯特桥上作，1803年9月3日

世上再无一物有更多明丽：
乏味灵魂才会轻易经过
它壮丽中如此动人的一景：
这座城市现正如一件衣服般
披上清晨的柔美；宁静，赤裸，
船只，高塔，穹顶，剧院及寺庙
向原野，向天空铺展；
在无烟的空气中全都明净，闪亮。
太阳从未灿烂地沉浸在
